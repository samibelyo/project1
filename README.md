# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using machine learning techniques, specifically a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9) accurately. In this project, we use the MNIST dataset, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, to train a machine learning model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code)

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.

## Model Training

The project includes Jupyter Notebook files (`train.ipynb`) that demonstrate how to:
- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
- Build and train a neural network model using PyTorch
- Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set
- Save and load the trained model for inference

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies (`PyTorch`, `Jupyter Notebook`).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git`
3. run the notebook
## Results

After training the model, the accuracy achieved on the test set is approximately XX%.

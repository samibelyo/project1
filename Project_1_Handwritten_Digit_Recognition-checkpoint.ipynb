    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n",
    "1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in with your account.\n",
    "2. **Create a New Repository**: Click on the '+' icon in the top right corner and select 'New repository'.\n",
    "3. **Name Your Repository**: Give your repository a meaningful name, like 'handwritten-digit-recognition'.\n",
    "4. **Initialize with a README**: Check the box 'Initialize this repository with a README'.\n",
    "5. **Create Repository**: Click the 'Create repository' button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine\n",
    "1. **Copy the Repository URL**: On your repository page on GitHub, click the 'Code' button and copy the URL.\n",
    "2. **Clone in Terminal**: Open your terminal, navigate to where you want the repository, and run `git clone [URL]`, replacing `[URL]` with the URL you copied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Add Your Project to the Repository\n",
    "1. **Copy Your Notebook**: Place your Jupyter notebook file into the cloned repository folder on your local machine.\n",
    "2. **Add the File**: Run `git add [filename]` in your terminal, replacing `[filename]` with the name of your notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes\n",
    "1. **Commit Your Changes**: Run `git commit -m \"Add project notebook\"`.\n",
    "2. **Push to GitHub**: Run `git push` to push your changes to the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Create and Edit the README File\n",
    "1. **Edit README.md**: On GitHub, open the README.md file and click the pencil icon to edit.\n",

    "3. **Save Changes**: After editing, commit your changes by clicking 'Commit changes' at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå TODOs for Submission:\n",
    "- Ensure your Jupyter notebook is well-commented and formatted.\n",

    "- Double-check that all files have been committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a well-documented GitHub repository not only reflects your technical skills but also your ability to communicate and present your work effectively. Happy coding and best of luck with your project submission! üåüüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª\n"
